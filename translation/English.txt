QUEST_BANDIT_1_4_QUESTINFODATA_ACTIONS_1_DEFAULTOUTCOME_JOURNALTEXT,"Our hero chased those bandits off, but only ended up enraging them. The farm was set alight, and our hero's pyrrhic victory not quite ideal."

QUEST_BANDIT_1_4_QUESTINFODATA_JOURNALENCOUNTERTEXT,"As misfortune would have it, the bandits controlling this farm were not just rivals, but vicious competitors with your own Bandit Clan."

QUEST_BANDIT_1_5_QUESTINFODATA_ENCOUNTERTEXT,"The prison in the small town is quite robust, with multiple floors and a small army of guards. This will not be an easy task."
QUEST_BANDIT_1_5_QUESTINFODATA_JOURNALENCOUNTERTEXT,"Our hero stood before the imposing structure and considered the options. This would either be a storied success, or legendary failure."
QUEST_BANDIT_1_5_QUESTINFODATA_JOURNALRUMOURTEXT,"<hero_name>'s quest for the throne would first take them to a small town, where bandit allies rotted in a massive prison."

QUEST_BANDIT_1_6_QUESTINFODATA_ACTIONS_1_DEFAULTOUTCOME_JOURNALTEXT,"<hero_name> was quick to realize that if the treasure hadn't yet been found, perhaps it never would. They left the peak, wiser for it."
QUEST_BANDIT_1_6_QUESTINFODATA_ACTIONS_1_DEFAULTOUTCOME_OUTCOMETEXT,"You assume that if nobody has found the treasure by now, you sure aren't going to find it. You descend the peak and feel smarter for it."
QUEST_BANDIT_1_6_QUESTINFODATA_ENCOUNTERTEXT,"You ascend the peak, looking this way and that for signs of where a treasure could be secreted. Deep down, you know it is here."
QUEST_BANDIT_1_6_QUESTINFODATA_JOURNALENCOUNTERTEXT,"Our hero ascended that bitter peak, searching high and low for signs of the treasure. It had to be somewhere close, if it existed at all."
